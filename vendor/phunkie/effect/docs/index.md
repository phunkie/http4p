# Phunkie Effect

A functional effects library for PHP inspired by Scala's cats-effect. Phunkie Effects provides a way to manage side effects in a purely functional way, making your code more predictable, testable, and maintainable.

## Overview

Phunkie Effect brings the power of purely functional programming to PHP, allowing you to describe side effects as values that can be composed, tested, and reasoned about before execution.
